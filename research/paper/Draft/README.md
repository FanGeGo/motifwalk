## Paragraph 1: Context

This paragraph should provides:
- Some context to orient those readers who are less familiar 
with graph and graph embedding.

### Main idea: Graph is important in many fields.

Graph (or network) data model is an useful tool for a wide range of 
disciplines and it is importance to have a low dimensionality 
representation of a complex graph.

### Supporting 1: What is graph (or network).

### Supporting 2: Many discoveries are from analizing graph structures.

### Supporting 3: What is complex network? Many system must be modeled as a complex network.

### Supporting 4: Dimensionality problem, mapping solution (PCA, CCA, embeddings).

### Supporting 5: Usefulness of embedding techniques.

### Conclusion: Graph model is important and learning latent representation can help solving many problems.

## Paragraph 2: Need (maybe skip for now)

Some of the "need" is mentioned in paragraph 1.

## Paragraph 3: Introduce skipgram with negative sampling

### Main idea: Careful negative sample selection algorithm improves the result.

### Supporting 1: Skipgram model depends on normalization factor estimation.

### Supporting 2: Common use is negative sampling which is a simplified version of NCE.

### Supporting 3: Control positive walk similar to node2vec proves to be useful.

### Supporting 4: Control negative sample generation will further improve the work.

### Supporting 5: Use motif and negative motif as basis for generating these.

## Paragraph 4: Structure of the document

### Main idea: The document is divided into 4 parts.

## Supporting 1: Methods and data.

## Supporting 2: Results.

## Supporting 3: Discussion.

## Supporting 4: Related works.

## Supporting 5: Discussion.
