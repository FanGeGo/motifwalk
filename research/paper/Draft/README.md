# Introduction

## Paragraph 1: Context

This paragraph should provides:
- Some context to orient those readers who are less familiar 
with graph and graph embedding.

### Main idea: Graph is important in many fields.

Graph (or network) data model is an useful tool for a wide range of 
disciplines and it is importance to have a low dimensionality 
representation of a complex graph.

### Supporting 1: What is graph (or network).

### Supporting 2: Many discoveries are from analizing graph structures.

### Supporting 3: What is complex network? Many system must be modeled as a complex network.

### Supporting 4: Dimensionality problem, mapping solution (PCA, CCA, embeddings).

### Supporting 5: Usefulness of embedding techniques.

### Conclusion: Graph model is important and learning latent representation can help solving many problems.
