# MotifWalk: Network local structural representation embedding.

Murata Laboratory - Tokyo Institute of Technology.

## Introduction

MotifWalk is a novel network embedding algorithm that not only encode the notion of proximity between nodes in a network, but also its local structure. By utilizing the local structures known as motif, we have successfully developed MotifWalk to learn meaningful dense vector representation of nodes in a complex network. MotifWalk is also fast and scalable. MotifWalk is written in Python and use TensorFlow framework for computation tasks.
